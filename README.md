# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Diabetes Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains my work for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as part of the Digital Assessment I. The aim of this project is to analyze the **Diabetes dataset** and gain insights through various analytical techniques.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this analysis is the **Diabetes dataset**, which includes various health attributes related to diabetes. You can access the dataset from the following link:

**Dataset Link:** [Diabetes Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salemprakash/EDA/main/Data/diabetes.csv)

## Objectives

1. Load the dataset and explore its dimensions and summary statistics.
2. Perform data handling and cleaning.
3. Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
4. Align tasks with the theoretical sessions from **Module 2 to Module 7**.

## Syllabus Overview

The tasks in this project are aligned with the following theoretical modules covered during the course. These modules provide the foundation for the analysis techniques and methods applied in this project:

### **Module 2: Data Transformation (4 hours)**
In this module, we cover transformation techniques such as performing data deduplication, replacing values, and discretization and binning. We also introduce methods for handling missing data, including traditional approaches like **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**.

### **Module 3: Correlation Analysis and Time Series Analysis (4 hours)**
This module includes the study of different types of analysis, such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. Additionally, we introduce **Time Series Analysis (TSA)**, focusing on its fundamentals, characteristics, time-based indexing, visualizing time series data, grouping, and resampling.

### **Module 4: Data Summarization and Visualization (4 hours)**
In this module, we explore statistical summary measures and various types of data analysis: 1-D, 2-D, and n-D statistical analysis, including **contingency tables**. We also introduce **visualization techniques** such as scatter plots, dot charts, and bar plots to summarize and present the data effectively.

### **Module 5: Clustering Algorithms (4 hours)**
This module introduces **clustering algorithms**, including **spectral clustering**, **document clustering**, and **minimum spanning tree clustering**. We also explore **model-based clustering**, the **Expectation-Maximization** algorithm, and the **Hierarchical Agglomerative model-based clustering**. Outlier detection using clustering techniques is also covered.

### **Module 6: Dimensionality Reduction (4 hours)**
In this module, we learn both **linear** and **non-linear** dimensionality reduction techniques. Linear methods include **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, and **Factor Analysis**, while non-linear methods include **Multidimensional Scaling**, **Manifold Learning**, and **Self-Organizing Maps**.

### **Module 7: Model Development and Evaluation (4 hours)**
This module focuses on constructing and evaluating **linear regression models**, computing accuracy, and understanding evaluation metrics. It also covers **reinforcement learning**, including the differences between **supervised** and **reinforcement learning**, and explores applications of reinforcement learning in various domains.
