# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Diabetes Dataset

## Project Overview

This repository contains my work for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project as part of the Digital Assessment I. The aim of this project is to analyze the Diabetes dataset and gain insights through various analytical techniques.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this analysis is the **Diabetes dataset**, which includes various health attributes related to diabetes. You can access the dataset from the following link:

**Dataset Link:** [Diabetes Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salemprakash/EDA/main/Data/diabetes.csv)

## Objectives

1. Load the dataset and explore its dimensions and summary statistics.
2. Perform data handling and cleaning.
3. Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
4. Align tasks with the theoretical sessions from **Module 2 to Module 7**.
